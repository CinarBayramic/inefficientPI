# compilation(g++):
- g++ what.cpp -o out.exe -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
#running the program
- ./out.exe <width> <height>

#notes:
- i recommend entering width and height the same as its the right way of calculating pi but if you do it different its for drawing a circle(can be enabled by uncommenting circlisation() function)
- this project is a side project that i did when i was bored i wont update it but i will accept pull requests adding real and fast ways of calculation or better visualisation
